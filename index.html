    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>📖 Our Story
Skillexa was born from a simple question:

“Why is talent ignored just because it isn’t measured by a degree?”

Founded by passionate minds who experienced this disconnect firsthand, Skillexa started as a mission to democratize skill certification.
We wanted to create a platform where skills like active listening, decision-making, and teamwork are valued just as much as coding or design.
With the power of AI, data, and empathy, we built a system that recognizes and rewards real abilities—in just minutes.
From dreamers to doers, Skillexa is for everyone.</p>

    <p>Today, Skillexa stands as a symbol of innovation and inclusion — and we’re just getting started.</p>
